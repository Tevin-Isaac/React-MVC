# E-commerce Shop
This is a simple e-commerce shop built with react framework.
Before you proceed with this project if you have no fundamentals about CRUD(Create,Read,Update,Delete) in React  kindly this  project link (https://github.com/Tevin-Isaac/react-crud),it contains a simple react application(https://react-crud-alpha.vercel.app/)   created by me  that will guide you and give you an overview of CRUD before you proceed  with this project.

### Live site
https://react-shop-steel.vercel.app/


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Back end
Rest API using json server

## Back-end set up
npm i json-Get a full fake REST API with zero coding in less than 30 seconds (seriously)

Created  for front-end developers who need a quick back-end for prototyping and mocking.
Please note you can create your own  custom REST API and use it if you need to.
